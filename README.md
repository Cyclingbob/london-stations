# London Stations
A project to accurately count the amount of railway stations in London
Since there's no clear boundary of where London ends. Most people say designated "Greater London" where the boroughs are. Others say inside the M25 motorway or where TFL tube reaches, or where TFL buses reach or where it's urban inside the M25.
I aim to introduce a map with filters and lists along with a system allowing you to tick off the one's you've visited/changed at.
